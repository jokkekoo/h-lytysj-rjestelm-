# Hälytysjärjestelmä

Alarm system which was my first project at OAMK.

It used 3 HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors to measure distance. If distance had changed it would start beeping which was awful and send a text message to the owners phone. 

The project also had a LCD screen for navigating a menu and a numpad for unlocking the device if alarm was set off. You could set your 4-digit pincode which was required to reset the alarm.
